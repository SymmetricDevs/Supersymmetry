susy.quest.db.869.desc=§aTrimethylolpropane Triacrylate (TMPTA)§r is the main chemical used in the photopolymerization of the photoemulsion when §crubylith§r is exposed to UV light, resulting in hardening. %n%nTo produce it, you first must produce §7§6trimethylolpropane§r, which is produced from the aldol condensation of formaldehyde and butyraldehyde, catalyzed with sodium hydroxide solution.%nButyraldehyde may be produced in this voltage through the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, which is produced from the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde with itself, also catalyzed with a sodium hydroxide solution.%n§b%nAcrylic acid§r, the other component in TMPTA, is produced from acetylene, carbon monoxide, water, and a cobalt-nickel bromide catalyst.%n%nFinally, combine these two components with sulfuric acid with heating to produce TMPTA.

susy.quest.db.876.title=Uranium Production Methodologies
susy.quest.db.876.desc=Currently, the only method to produce uranium is from carnotite. First, dissolve §bcarnotite§r in §d§chot sulfuric acid. §rThe resultant solution is then reduced with iron and calcite to transform the dissolved uranium into a extractable state. This mixture is subsequently contacted with uranium-vanadium extraction mixture (D2EHPA, TBP, and kerosene).%n%nAfter the liquid-liquid extraction, the resultant solution containing vanadium and §auranium§r is stripped with dilute sulfuric acid to remove the vanadium content. Next, soda ash solution is used to strip the §auranium§r out as §auranyl carbonate§r. The resultant stripped solution contains some particles of aluminium and iron carbonate, which is sifted out. The solution is then acidified with sulfuric acid to produce §auranyl sulfate§r. Ammonia is then introduced to precipitate §eammonium diuranate§r, a form of yellowcake. This is then calcined to produce §2uranium dioxide§r, which is a precursor to uranium metal (used in EV superconductors) and uranium hexafluoride, which is required for U235 enrichment.
