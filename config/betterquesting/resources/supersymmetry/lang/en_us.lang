At this stage you are nowhere near ready for killing any of them, so§c you must hide. §r
keys.betterquesting.desc.000018.name=A grindstone can be used for extracting more metal out of your ores. It's not that good... but it's a start. It's also §cmanual§r, so you have to power it using your hands.\n\nPut a §6Wooden Crank §ron top of the grindstone and §aright click §ron it to rotate it. After a few rotations, the ore will have turned into crushed ores.\n\nPutting 2 ore in results in an output of 3 crushed ores. \n\nThese crushed ores can then be smelted into ingots, or processed further to get things such as §bImpure Ore Dusts§f or §bCentrifuged Ores§f to get more value out of your ores.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000019.name=Breaking leaves§r with a piece of Flint§r or a Flint Knife will drop a stick. However, Flint Shards will not work.

keys.betterquesting.desc.000021.name=§rMore advanced tools will be needed to progress towards the Industrial Age. There are six major types of tools.\n\n§6§lBronze tools should be made first, since you are quite a bit away from iron.§r \n\nThe §2hammer §ris used kind of everywhere. It's used to make all the other tools and it turns ingots into plates\nThe §2file§r turns ingots into rods.\nThe §2saw §rturns wood planks into slabs, and turns logs into 6 planks.\nThe §2screwdriver§r is used in most recipes and in setting up covers. It also makes important parts like gears and rotors.\nThe §2wrench§r is used in cutting pipes and it's probably the most important tools out of all of them.\nThe §2wire cutter§r cuts wiring.\n\n§l§c§lBoth JEI and the book will show iron tools wherever tools are used. Tools other than iron will not show up in the JEI search. Bronze tools exist and should be made first. Generally, recipes accept all kinds of tools.§r
keys.betterquesting.desc.000022.name=A furnace is not really good for smelting items. Its maximum temperature is only 1000 K (730°C), which is not hot enough for iron.\n\nA Primitive Blast Furnace is made out of 32 §cFirebricks§r and 1 §4Primitive Blast Furnace Controller§r. It's a  §a3x4x3 structure§r§r of firebricks that is hollowed out in the middle. For more help, look at the §cStructure Preview§r in the JEI database.\n\nThe Primitive Blast Furnace can smelt iron, wrought iron and §bsteel§r. It has a maximum temperature of about 1400 K (1,127°C).\n\nLike many other structures, it is possible to share the walls of multiple Primitive Blast Furnaces and they will still work.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000023.name=§7Sphalerite §rveins contain §7sphalerite ore§r, an important source of zinc. It's found on Earth at altitude 0 to 60, but also in the deepest part of the crust.\n\nZinc is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance.\n\nZinc will be used to create magnets, but if you can't find zinc, §amagnetite ore §rcan be used instead.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000024.name=To make magnets, you must have a §bVoltaic Pile§r. §c\n§r\nA Voltaic Pile is made of three components: a §6Copper Plate§r, a §7Zinc Plate§r, and Electrolyte Paper.\n\nA common electrolyte is §6citric acid§r. Putting lemons, limes, or oranges with paper will create electrolyte paper. Limes can be found in jungles, lemons can be found in jungle edges and forests, while oranges can be found in savannah biomes. \n\nIf you can't get a hold of a voltaic pile, you can use another method for magnetizing an iron rod, using §6magnetite§r.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000025.name=§7Iron §ris the most common element on planet Earth. It is used for refining it into §6steel§r [see the next page] and for basic tools. It is one of the most important metals of the Industrial Age.\n\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces (such as a §cBlast Furnace§r) capable of reaching 1,500 °C (1,773K) or higher, about 500 °C higher than that required to smelt copper. \n\n
keys.betterquesting.desc.000026.name=To start, you will need an §ciron rod§r - make an ingot of iron into a rod (with the file), then put it in a furnace.\n\nThere are two ways of making magnets:\n\n- Putting a hot iron rod with a §cmagnetite chunk§r in a crafting table, \n- or using the §cvoltaic pile §ralong with some §ccopper fine wire§r (you need special equipment though).§ \n\nThis process is only done once§r. A newly-formed §cmagnetic iron rod § can be used to magnetise other hot iron rods so don't throw it out!\n\n§3This will unlock the Industrial Age.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000027.name=§7Magnetite §rores can be broken up into §7magnetite chunks§r by using a Crafting Table. They can be used to magnetize an §6iron rod§r.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000028.name=We can make better tools out of §6bronze§r. You need to make the tool parts first, and then assemble the tool.\n\nThe bronze axe can cut down entire trees with just one click.\n\nThe bronze mining hammer can mine an entire 3x3 meter area with one click, unless you're pressing §aSHIFT§r.\n\nThe bronze spade does the same thing as the mining hammer, except it works with blocks which work with shovels, such as dirt and sand.\n\n§c§lBoth JEI and the book will show iron tools wherever tools are used. Tools other than iron will not show up in the JEI search. Bronze tools exist and should be made first. Generally, recipes accept all kinds of tools.§r
keys.betterquesting.desc.000029.name=Use your new alloy to make a §6bronze sword§r.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000030.name=§6Steel§r is an alloy of iron and carbon with §6improved strength§r and fracture resistance compared to other forms of iron.\n\nA §cPrimitive Blast Furnace §rcan turn iron ingots into §l§esteel§r, by smelting them with coal coke. \n\nMaking steel is one of the top priorities of the Industrial Age. Make sure to have your Primitive Blast Furnace running at all times, or try to make 4 Primitive Blast Furnaces sharing their walls.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000031.name=The goals for the Industrial Age is to obtain steam machines, making vacuum tubes and getting electricity.\n\nThe following information will be critical to your survival, so read it carefully!\n\n\n§l§nHow do I get steam?§r\n\nThere are different ways to produce steam, there is the §c§cCoal Boiler§r,§c Lava Boiler§r, the §cSolar Boiler§r, and the §cLarge Boilers§r. A good option right now is the Coal Boiler.\n\nThe Coal Boiler is powered by §cfurnace fuels§r and is extremely fuel efficient. It will take some time to heat up, and once hot enough it will §c§rconsume water§r and §c§rautomatically output steam§r into connected pipes. Remember that boilers can §4§l§nexplode§r when they're already hot, have no water and you add some water.\n\n§l§nHow do Steam machines work?§r\n\n§n§l§rSteam machines are §6slow§r, §6need pipe connection§r, and §6do not auto-output§r.\nThey also have an §6exhaust vent§r, represented by a gray square on their backside by default. \nThis vent can be moved using a wrench, but §6must remain unblocked§r. \nWhen a recipe is completed, the vent will start shooting steam particles in the air, and if you're standing near the vent, you will be §c§lboiled alive\n\n§l§nI'm still confused!\n§rWatch this video if you need some help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR3KGYtaEtM\n\n§r------------------------------------\n§3CHAPTER 1 - STARTING A REVOLUTION\n§r------------------------------------\n§r- Industrialize\n- Use the power of steam\n- Start producing electricity\n- Create the most basic electronics\n\nTier : 1 \nEU/t : 0 \n------------------------------------\n        
keys.betterquesting.desc.000032.name=The §l§rSteam Alloy Smelter §rdirectly combines dusts or ingots into §c§lnew alloys.\n\n§rThis machine requires a fair amount of steam to work. If it ever runs out of steam, the machine can be turned off with a §aSoft Hammer§r.\n\nThe §6Alloy Smelter§r can make bronze directly, using §dingots§o§o§r, dusts, or even nuggets.§r You can make a nugget mold as well to turn ingots into nuggets. \n\nNOTE: Like all steam machines, the output port doubles as a steam outlet when recipes complete. §cIt must not be blocked§r. Also, steam is hot and can damage you if touched. Change the output side by whacking the Alloy Smelter with a wrench.\n   
keys.betterquesting.desc.000033.name=The §6Steam Macerator §ris used to convert ores into crushed ores. This is the most simple way of doing ore processing.\n\nEvery ore put into the Steam Macerator turns into 2 crushed ores, that can be smelted in the Furnace or PBFto get two ingots.\n
keys.betterquesting.desc.000034.name=§6Molds§o§r can be used in the alloy smelter and the fluid solidifier. You need them to make vacuum tubes.\nThey can be used for turning dusts into ingots, or ingots into gears, using the alloy smelter.§r\n

Later on, rubber allows you to create circuitry.\nRubber is made from §5§6Latex§r, a fluid which is collected by putting a §6Steam Latex Collector §rnear a Rubber Tree. \n\nMake sure that the Collector is touching a Rubber Log on the §6white §rside of the machine.
keys.betterquesting.desc.000036.name=The §7LV Conveyor Module §ris the fourth machine component you will need. \n\nIt can be also used as a cover to move items around. \n\nThe Conveyor Module, when placed on a machine, will transfer items to the block adjacent to the face it’s on. You can configure it to import or export items from the machine or item pipe you place it on.\n\nVoltages are irrelevant when placing covers on machines, so, for example, you can safely put an LV conveyor module on HV machines and vice versa.\n
keys.betterquesting.desc.000037.name=§d§rNickel is a silvery-white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge. It is a hard and ductile transition metal. \n\n§e§dNickel§r is found in §6Garnierite§r, §6Pentlandite§r, §6§rand §6Nickel §rores. They are found in the second layer of Earth's crust, called "The Beneath" by villagers.\n\nMining deeper in the crust requires special equipment.

keys.betterquesting.desc.000055.name=Macerating is still an ore doubler like in other mods, but there is a twist, it does not give dusts directly! Crushed Ores are meant for more advanced ore processing. One Crushed Ore will convert to one dust.\n\nTo get the Impure Dust§r, hammer the Crushed Ore. \n\nThis is done either by using a Hammer tool in the crafting table, or using the Steam Forge Hammer.\n\nThe Impure Dust can be smelted in the Furnace to get the Ingot, however mixed ores (Limonite, Chalcopyrite) will only give nuggets over ingots.\n\nThe Impure Dust can also be thrown in a vanilla Cauldron filled with water to clean it and turn it into a regular dust. Throw them in full stacks to consume less water per single dust.\n\n§lNote: Macerating, hammering, and then smelting (sometimes into nuggets) is really time consuming in the steam age! Resource efficiency can be ignored for now. Nobody will blame you for smelting ores directly into ingots.\n

The oceans cover approximately 70% of the planet's surface, while the remaining 30% is made up of land.\n\nThe mountains on Earth can reach incredible heights. Forests on Earth are abundant and provide a home for many different species of plants and animals. These forests are a vital component of the planet's ecosystem and play an essential role in regulating the Earth's climate. \n\n§cBy digging down from the Earth's surface, one can encounter three types of rocks: Sedimentary, Igneous and Metamorphic. Sedimentary rocks, like limestone, can be found at altitude levels up to 40, while igneous rocks, like gabbro or granite, can be found between 0 and 40.\n\nUnder the Earth there is a cave system called The Beneath. This cave system is a complex network of underground tunnels, chambers, and passageways that stretches over a significant distance. You can get to it by digging down to Y level 0.\n\n
