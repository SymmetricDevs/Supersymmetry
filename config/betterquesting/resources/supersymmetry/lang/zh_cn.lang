susy.quest.db.876.desc=Currently, the only method to produce uranium is from carnotite. First, dissolve §bcarnotite§r in §d§chot sulfuric acid. §rThe resultant solution is then reduced with iron and calcite to transform the dissolved uranium into a extractable state. This mixture is subsequently contacted with uranium-vanadium extraction mixture（D2EHPA, TBP, and kerosene）.%n%nAfter the liquid-liquid extraction, the resultant solution containing vanadium and §auranium§r is stripped with dilute sulfuric acid to remove the vanadium content. Next, soda ash solution is used to strip the §auranium§r out as §auranyl carbonate§r. The resultant stripped solution contains some particles of aluminium and iron carbonate, which is sifted out. The solution is then acidified with sulfuric acid to produce §auranyl sulfate§r. Ammonia is then introduced to precipitate §eammonium diuranate§r, a form of yellowcake.
