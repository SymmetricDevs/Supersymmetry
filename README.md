# Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry is a complex tech-centered modpack based around GregTech that integrates chemical and physical processes from reality into its progression. This means having many different crafting chains that imitate manufacturing processes used in real life.
The pack spans many different levels of technological mastery, from the steam engine to the nuclear reactor to unbelievably advanced technology in the realm of science fiction. It also incorporates elements from theoretical physics, allowing the player to exploit phenomena that have never before been seen in Minecraft.
Every mod has its progression altered to fit into GregTech progression. As a consequence of this, automation and mass production are vital, encouraging the construction of large factories and transportation networks to move resources and products. The player will have to conquer Overworld and its resources first, then move on to establish a permanent presence in space, then explore the solar system, and finally move outwards into interstellar space, exploring a variety of planets with unique challenges, world generation, and enemies to face, to get access to the most exotic and rare resources in the cosmos, starting from nothing and building something even more expansive than a Kardashev type III civilization.

The pack is currently in Beta. You can join the discord server here:
