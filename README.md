# Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry is a complex tech centered modpack, based around GregTech, which tries to integrate real chemical and physical processes into its progression, this means having many different crafting chains which imitate real manufacturing processes.
The pack spans many different levels of technological mastery, from the steam engine, to the nuclear reactor, to unbelievably advanced technology in the realm of science fiction, it also incorporates elements from theoretical physics, allowing the player to exploit phenomena that have never been seen before in minecraft (well, as far as I know anyway).
Every mod will have its progression altered to better fit the GregTech style of progression, as a consequence of this automation and mass production are vital, encouraging the construction of large factories and transportation networks to move resources and products. The player will have to first conquer the overworld and its resources, then move on to establish a permanent presence in space, conquering the solar system, and finally moving outwards in interstellar space, exploring a variety of planets with unique challenges, world generation, and enemies to face, in order to get access to the most exotic and rare resources in the cosmos, starting from nothing and building something even more powerful than a Kardashev type III civilisation.

The pack is currently in alpha, you can join the discord server:
