# Supersymmetry
Supersymmetry is a complex tech-centered modpack based around GregTech that integrates chemical and physical processes from reality into its progression. This means having many different crafting chains that imitate manufacturing processes used in real life.

Much of it is in-development, with PvE elements such as environmental factors and raids of enemy factions being planned. We intend to have our own [space-faring mod](https://github.com/SymmetricDevs/GregicalityStarbound) as well.

Progression defies the well-established GT power tiers, as the pack aims to break up the rigid progression. Innovation does not let itself be dictated by higher force, it happens through research and discoveries. 
## Implemented Content
As time of writing, following systems and mechanics have been added or modified from default state:
- Custom Chemical Reactors
- Weaponry and Military (Derived from TechGuns and ICBM)
- Infinite Ore Deposits with related processing
- Froth Floatation
- Catalysts
- Extensive revamps in petrochemistry, metallurgy and cryogenics
  - Polymer processing lines
  - Superconductors

Some mods (AE2, Stargate, TARDIS) are listed in the pack, but not legitimately obtainable. Subject to change. 
Specifically, AE2 is going to be obtained after space travel is possible. 

## Vision
The pack spans many different levels of technological mastery, from the steam engine to the nuclear reactor. It also incorporates elements from theoretical physics, allowing the player to exploit phenomena that have never before been seen in Minecraft. 

Every mod has its progression altered to fit into GregTech progression. As a consequence of this, automation and mass production are vital, encouraging the construction of large factories and transportation networks to move resources and products. 
The player will have to conquer Overworld and its resources first, then move on to establish a permanent presence in space, then explore the solar system, and finally move outwards into interstellar space, exploring a variety of planets with unique challenges, world generation, and enemies to face, to get access to the most exotic and rare resources in the cosmos, starting from nothing and building something even more expansive than a Kardashev type III civilization.

The pack is currently in Beta. You can join the discord server here:
